# Deleting Documents

## Deleting Documents in Firestore Eloquent Library

Deleting documents in Firestore is an essential operation, and the Firestore Eloquent Library in Laravel offers convenient methods to remove documents from a collection. Let's explore how to delete documents using the library's features.

### Delete Many Documents with ``deleteMany()``

:::warning
Deleting many documents in a collection can take a long time if there are a lot of documents in the sub collection.
:::

The **``deleteMany()``** method allows you to delete multiple documents in a Firestore collection based on a specified query. You can use this method to delete documents that match certain conditions.

#### Basic Deletion

Let's say we want to delete all documents in the **``users``** collection that have the **``age``** field set to **``18``**. We can use the **``deleteMany()``** method to delete all documents that match this condition.

```php
// Delete all users with age 20
User::where(['age', '=',  20])->deleteMany();
```

#### Deletion with Multiple Conditions

You can also delete documents that match multiple conditions. Let's say we want to delete all users with the **``age``** field set to **``20``** and the **``name``** field set to **``John``**. We can use the **``deleteMany()``** method to delete all documents that match this condition.

```php
// Delete all users with age 20 and name John
User::andWhere(['age', '=',  20], ['name', '=', 'John'])->deleteMany();
```

### Delete Single Document with ``delete()``

The **``delete()``** method allows you to delete a single document in a Firestore collection. You can use this method to delete a document that matches a certain condition.

#### Examples

Let's say we want to delete a user with the **``age``** field set to **``20``**. We can use the **``delete()``** method to delete the document that matches this condition.

```php
// Delete a user with the specified ID
$user = User::where(['user_id', '=', $userId])->first();
$user->delete();
```

```php
// Delete a user with the specified ID
$user = User::where(['user_id', '=', $userId])->firstOrFail();
$user->delete();
```
