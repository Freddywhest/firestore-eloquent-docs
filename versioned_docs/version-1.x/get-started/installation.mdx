    composer require roddy/firestore-eloquent
    ```

2. Add the following line to the `service providers` array within your `config/app.php` file:

    ```php
    Roddy\FirestoreEloquent\Providers\FModelProvider::class,
    ```

3. Copy and paste this to your `.env` file and replace `path/to/firebase-credentials.json` with the path to your credentials JSON file:

    ```dotenv
    GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path/to/firebase-credentials.json
    ```

4. Copy and paste this to your `.env` file and replace `https://<your-project>.firebaseio.com` with the database URL for your project. You can find the database URL for your project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/project/_/settings/general):
