# Introduction

This Laravel library provides an Eloquent-like interface for interacting with Firestore, Google Cloud's NoSQL database. The library is designed to simplify common Firestore operations, making it easier to integrate Firestore into your PHP applications.

## What it is

Firestore Eloquent is a customized version of Laravel Eloquent designed for seamless integration with Google Firestore within Laravel applications. Firestore boasts exceptional scalability and speed, but it provides a more limited feature set compared to conventional SQL databases.

See the [Get Started](/docs/get-started/installation) guide for more details.
