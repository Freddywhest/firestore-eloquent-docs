# Aggregations

## Aggregations in Firestore Eloquent Library

Aggregations are a common operation to retrieve the number of records that match certain conditions. The Firestore Eloquent Library in Laravel provides a straightforward way to count documents based on specified criteria. Let's explore how to count documents using the library's features.

### Counting All Documents


To count all documents in a Firestore collection, you can use the **``count()``** method:

```php
// Count all users
$totalUsers = User::count();
```

### Summing a Field

$totalAges = User::sum('age');
```

### Average of a Field
