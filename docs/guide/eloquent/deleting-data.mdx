# Deleting Documents

### Delete Single Document with ``delete()``

The **``delete()``** method allows you to delete a single document in a Firestore collection. You can use this method to delete a document that matches a certain condition.

#### Examples

Let's say we want to delete a user with the **``age``** field set to **``20``**. We can use the **``delete()``** method to delete the document that matches this condition.

```php
// Delete a user with the specified ID
$user = User::where(['user_id', '=', $userId])->first();
$user->delete();
```

```php
// Delete a user with the specified ID
$user = User::where(['user_id', '=', $userId])->firstOrFail();
$user->delete();
```
