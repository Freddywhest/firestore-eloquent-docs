# Pagination

## Pagination in Firestore Eloquent Library

If your Firestore collection contains a large number of documents, you may paginate your search results using the paginate method. This method will return an ``Illuminate\Pagination\LengthAwarePaginator`` instance just as if you had [paginated a traditional Eloquent query](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/pagination).

The **``paginate()``** method allows you to retrieve a specific number of documents per page, making it easier to navigate through large result sets.

The **``paginate()``** method accepts two arguments:

- The number of documents to retrieve per page
- The current page number

```php
// Paginate all users with 10 users per page
$currentPage = request()->get('page', 1);
$users = User::paginate(10, $currentPage);

// Get pagination links
$users->links();
```

For more information about pagination, please refer to the [Pagination Documentation](/docs/guide/eloquent/pagination).
